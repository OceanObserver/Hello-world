# Hello-world
A whole new world of coding
Hi, I'm Emer, the Founder of Ocean Research & Conservation Ireland and Ocean Research Consultants, I am learning to code to create impage processing software that can help revolutionise how marine wildlife surveys are conducted
I added a readme-edits branch becasue the instructions told me to? Also becasue I want you to be able to understand what changes I make and why.
